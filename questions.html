    My wife and I become foster parents in 2016. We did respite care for a month and then fostered a 3 month old girl for 6 months total. In January 2017 we fostered a 6 week old boy that we would eventually adopt. Indiana DCS knew both of his parents from previous cases and quickly determined that neither side of his family could ever care for him - so after a long DCS case where his parents tried their hardest to meet DCS standards of care, they both eventually had their parental rights terminated. We were finally able to adpot him in May 2019 and make him a permanent member of our family!
