    <h4><a id="daycare"></a>Decorating for someone special</h4>
    <p>
    For children that are not of public school age, if they will not be kept home and watched by a foster parent then day care is an option. The monthly per diem for the child should be enough to pay for daycare. The Indiana Child Care Finder is a great tool to help families search for quality, local child care options. Other options include Bauer Family Resources - they provide quality daycare at no cost for foster children. Links to both resources are below!

    <h4><a id="networks"></a>Fostering Networks</h4>
    <p>
    While fostering is a wonderful way to open up your home to those in need, sometimes foster parents need a break or desire to connect with other foster parents. Contacting your Foster Care Specialist can help with finding respite care providers for breaks or vacations. The Villages Kids also provides group activities for foster parents and foster children to network with others like them!
