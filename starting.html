    <li>Ensure your home is neat and clean</li>
    <br>
    <li>Ensure that each child has his or her OWN room - they cannot share.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Ensure each child has their OWN crib or bed.</li>    
    <br>
    <li>Ensure your home has been child proofed with plug protectors and baby gates if needed.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <br>
